# Greedy-Approach-For-Traffic-Light-Problem
This is a greedy solution for Traffic-Light control by graph coloring algorithm .

## Description
Consider we have some roads which some of them are two way and others are one way and they are connected some where and 
we want to control the traffic by a traffic light. So we as programmer shoud be able to program that thing 0_0. in this 
project we define a graph that its nodes represent a pair of path and its edge are conflict between them. let me explain 
by an example consider roads like image below:

Now our nodes are AB, AC, AD, BA, BC, BD, DA, DB, DC, EA, EB, EC, ED. Also for example consider EA it has confilic with AB,
AC, AD because when people are going from E to A people in A can go any where but other roads are available. 
We can defin any situation like this solve it by this greedy algorithm project.


## Installing
